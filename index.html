    <p>Animal Rights.</p>
  </main> Animal rights are being abused and exploited each day such as dog cage fights, starving the animals. Animal abuse can be in different forms such as neglect means to shame the animal and  it needs to stop. Something that is causing animal rights to go down is that humans are abusing dogs and their rights to be able to live freely.
Something that causes animal abuse is bad monitoring, mental health, bad living environment for the animal, stress. Animal abuse first started in 8500 BC when archaeologists have found bones with deformities hinting that living situations back then could show signs of animal abuse.
